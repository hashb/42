# 42_piscine

A totally new and immersive experience,  in which only motivation, willpower and
hard work  will keep  you afloat.  This 4-week basic  training is  an incredibly
rewarding, once in-a-lifetime experience.

We start with the basics, and using  a computer, you will write your first lines
of  code  before  moving  on  to more  complex  coding  exercises.  No  previous
programming experience required! We simply ask that  you know how to use a mouse
and a keyboard.

Throughout  this experience,  you will  try  and you  will fail,  over and  over
again. That’s  the point: learning  the trial-and-error process  builds stamina,
determination, and process skills that are necessary to be a software engineer.

Basic Training is done  using the 42 style of learning:  no teachers, no classes
or courses,  no books. You work  by yourself and  in groups, ask your  peers for
help, help your peers, and complete projects. Not convinced? Try it!
